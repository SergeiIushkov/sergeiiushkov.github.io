<html><h1>Real-Time Bus Tracker Exercise</h1>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This is first application that actually may present real value. I was happy to do complete it. This educational project already involved 4 independent types of code: in html/css/js and MapboxAPI</p>
<br>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p>To run this just download whole folder busTrackerExample and open the index.html file.</p>
<br>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>This is educational project for testing html/css/js and MapboxAPI combinations.</p>
<br>
<h4>Support</h4>
<p>No support is provided with this application.</p>
<br>
<h4>Roadmap</h4>
<p>This app may have plenty of useful applications.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    For example, any user that has some skills in html/css/js and MapboxAPI may create his own custom pages that only reflects buses that he or she uses. Instead of using other software now we can make our own small and convinient products.
  </li>
  <li>
    We can use MapboxAPI for any data that content zip or coordinates: weather, amount of road accidents, density of wildlife, criminal actiivities, average noise levels etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    We can change products with open source for our needs. For example, if certain application content of 50 different maps, but we only need 2, we can change code and reduce size of app at the same time improving performance.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    We can add plenty of other models of pacmen or other creatures and allow them to be generated randomly.
  </li>
  <li>
    We can make Pacmen or other models change their speed after bounces or change models after collisions.
  </li>
  <li>
    We can make Pacmen consume one another based on initial speed, so naturally only fastest will stay on screen etc.
